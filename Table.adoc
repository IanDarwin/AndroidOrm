|===========

1. Numbers shown are the year the first commit (where known), the number of commits, and the year of the most recent commit to the source code, so you can judge the project's maturity and its activity, both important when choosing to use a software project.
Numbers may be inaccurate or out-of-date, and may not reflect commits before the project moved to public hosting.
Please check up-to-date numbers on the project's source code page,
and make your own comparison before settling among the top few projects that interest you.

2. ActiveAndroid has its own annotations with conflicting names: @Table, @Column
You could have both present but can't +import+ both, so you would have to write e.g.,
++@com.activeandroid.annotation.Column++.

3. db4o was acquired by Versant, which seems to prefer its own technology; db4o has not had much
by way of updates since. However, the download (from http://community.versant.com/Downloads/db4o.aspx)
includes the entire source code - 4.0 is a 40Mb download! They do not appear to offer a public
source code repository.
