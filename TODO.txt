ToDo:

* TemplateReceiver should be called TemplateSaver.
* Get BatooJPA enhancer to work under Maven.
* Finish all the other projects.

A Query feature (with a Search Box on the EntryActivity calling a
platform-specific module, if the search class were listed in the
androidorm.properties file) would be truly lovely.
